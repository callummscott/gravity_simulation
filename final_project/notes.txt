- Give every property a _score_, and I can then hardcode the weights for the things I care about.

- Rightmove's 'propertCard's seem to show 24 images, the last two of which are for the next 'page', and it
  seems to omit the first two/three from each page (the featured propert + 2 more)



  Project Overview

Project Name: Letting Agency Data Scraper and Property Evaluator

Objective: Create a Python program that scrapes data from various letting websites, applies user-defined filters, and evaluates properties based on user preferences.

Components:

Data Scraping Functions:
Separate functions for each letting website to apply filters to standard URLs
Scrape main pages to retrieve URL information of listed properties
Scrape individual property pages to retrieve relevant information
Property Evaluation Functions:
Model user preferences to generate a representative score for each property
Integrate publicly available data on crime, noise pollution, and air quality
Visualization and Output:
Allow users to sort properties based on evaluation scores
Generate colored icons or symbolic tools to visually display evaluation information on a map
Functionality:

Scrape data from multiple letting websites
Apply user-defined filters to property listings
Evaluate properties based on user preferences and external data
Provide visual representation of property evaluations on a map

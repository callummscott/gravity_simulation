# Introduction
This repo contains what is half of a personal undertaking of mine and half a CS50P final project for submission for 24/25.
It contains a 3D newtonian-gravity n-body particle simulation, coded in Python 3.12.5, which when run will show a 3D static `pyplot` of the particle paths.

## Change of plans
The project was originally intended to function as a web scraper to collect information from a variety of lettings agencies in my local area, but despite taking considerate precautions to 
throttle requests, concerns about the legality and violating website ToS ultimately brought that project to a close.

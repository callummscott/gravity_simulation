A couple of options to start with here:
    [ ] Focus on implementing a 2D animated image of events from a chosen 'POV' particle,
        choosing an arbitary view direction -- i.e. to begin with at least

    [ ] Focus on getting the 'scale' of the values, converting distances to 'AU', time to
        months, and mass to'Earth masses' units instead of the current nonsense values
        -- mainly a mathsy, cerebral process
        [ ] Then actually implement solar-system accurate values for the simulation

    [ ] Implementing a loading bar to display how far along the simulation is

    [ ] Implement 'collisions'? Interesting... but yeah maybe not.

    [-] Add some `logging` functionality to the whole thing

    [ ] **Provide an estimation for the time to simulate given the input criteria**

    [ ] Warn the user about the ranges of specific inputs, if particles will escape,
        or if particles are likely to collide, maybe
